    <h2 style="color:#524550;text-align:left;">B.Sc Computer Science Programme</h2>
    <p>The B.Sc. (Hons) degree in Computer Science is a four- year programme for UTME candidates and a three-year programme for direct entry candidates that provides the graduate with a broad scientific background in preparation for a successful career in a variety of occupations as outlined in the Philosophy and Objectives, providing in the process a solid academic base upon which to build more advanced degrees (M. Sc., Ph. D) if so desired.

The department places adequate emphasis on theoretical as well as practical work in the laboratories and during the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme. At the 400 level, students carryout individual projects in the areas of their specialization.
